## Big Adjustments

### Grid

Using the Rewards settings page as a basis, all the columns were shifted to align to a responsive 12 column grid. This is extra important as the wallet component that drops down from the toolbar is pulling it's fixed width from the settings page column sizing which isn’t following any column grid I can match.

```

Settings, Welcome Screens, Private Windows, Brave Rewards Settings Page, Shields Panel and the Rewards Panel all seem be heavily leveraging a modular “card” layout where elements are broken up into contained boxes inside columns. It would almost be foolish to not leverage a modularized layout of some sort since thus far we have designed as if it's intended for it to be responsive but have then directed for it to be fixed width.

```

To further drive home the importance of us aligning to embrace responsiveness, the card containers of the Rewards Settings page are a fixed width. This means there is no responsive adjustment when the browser window is resized and instead content starts getting hidden at the edge of the browser if it is resized below 1011px. This is incredibly undesirable.

```image

```

This means that roughly 34% of the population who is using a monitor 1366px wide adjust their browser window size down by any more than 15% they start to hide really important content on the page. This can't be overstated enough, the web page being responsive is and extremely important usability concern and solving for it will make Product, Design and Dev's life tremendously easier.

Making the webpage responsive enough to format for smaller screens without needing to completely rewrite and manage multiple sets of code for every component is a very important initiative we should take seriously at this early stage. Continuing in the way we are currently headed could possibly quadruple our workload in the long run. As it stands we don't currently share almost any functionality between desktop and mobile. So, we would have to write and maintain at least twice as much code. If you consider it needs to be able to inherit a dark and light theme, the amount of work is staggering. Desktop, Tablet (since it’s not responsive it would need rewritten), Android and iPhone for light and dark theme with no shared components all to end up with an experience that isn't as good.

### Table/List Components

```image

```

We have created a component that falls right in the middle of what many would consider a "List" component and a table. In most instances on the Rewards Settings pages, the cards are utilizing a full fledged table as well as this hybrid list component. In the wallet panel, since it's a summary, it's serving more of a List role. Sorting, filtering, selecting, expanding are not consideration that this element seems to need to be able to assume.

I have seen others break it down into [HTML Table/Data Table (Carbon)](http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage#basic-data-table), [List/Table (Ant)](https://ant.design/components/list/) and then many others just consolidate to a "Table" component. I actually think this might be a good avenue to split them out now. Lists being used in summaries feels much more appropriate than utilizing a fully fledged sortable and filterable data table. If users rack up enough traffic, they will be looking at the equivelant of bank statements and they will want to sort, filter, search and navigate through those tables. We should set up the foundation to facilitate that.

The table component is an incredibly robust component with tremendous responsivity consideration that we will need to iron out and define over time. With that said, there are some preliminary steps we can take to align styling and functionality for table components across our designs but it's going to result in us initially dialing back the variance and then adding to it deliberately. This actually pertains to both the List and Table component. It's a really difficult component to manage and can break or format very poorly if we don't spend time ensuring it works in all use cases.

```

As it currently stands, the list and table component exhibits quite a bit of variance. The wallet portion incorporates 6 unique colors, 4 unique typographic sizes, and 2 font weights and they seem to change per row. This needs consideration as a shared component now since Rewards won't be the only feature to leverage the List component. This would put the responsibility on us to define the colors for every list/table we create which is unsustainable. This is somewhat moot as in my experience color in the context of a wallet is very usually reserved to refer to the intent of transaction it is. Green for income, red for withdrawal. If we have 6 unique colors user won't ever notice intent colors.

Additionally, color in this context is also very often used to signal to the user that an element is a link or button. This is usually done either by appearing like a hyperlink or having some type of hover state. When we go to introduce interactive elements within rows users won't be able to discern which are clickable and which aren't if we have that many colors.

## Component Parity Updates

1. Using the “large” responsive layout grid at the smallest size before reaching a breakpoint, the rewards cards were adjusted to align to a grid at 860px wide.
2. Set up preliminary spacing for the wallet card that includes 16px padding on the container.
    - This follows a tentative but well thought out spacing rule of using 8px increments to space elements.

    ```image
    light: true
    plain: true
    span: 4
    src: "/log/nov2018/2018-11-21-11-54-41.png"
    ```

3. Adjusted the opacity designations on the typography
    - There were 6 or so different opacity designations on the typography that didn’t seem to follow a pattern. If we decide to utilize opacity more intentionally to show hierarchy within our type, it should follow a pattern of some sort with consistent values on specific elements for a reason that isn't to generate different colors. In this instance it's actually more likely to behave well as this specific section of the wallet will not inherit theme variables. That said, it's still a touchy practice and one that we should use selectively.
4. Set the border radius of the card to a tentative value of 12.
5. Aligned the entire card to be consistent with our type scale designations
    ```image
    light: true
    plain: true
    span: 6
    src: "/log/nov2018/type.png"
    ```
6. Adjusted the "Add funds" and "Rewards Settings" buttons in the wallet header to leverage the shared Small Tertiary button component.
    ```image
    light: true
    span: 4
    src: "/log/nov2018/2018-11-21-12-02-51.png"
    ```
    ```image
    light: true
    plain: true
    span: 6
    src: "/log/nov2018/margins.png"
    ```
7. Using the 8px spacing rule, the elements within the card were adjusted to reflect a consistent cadence of spacing between rows and elements.
    - Consistent padding on the container
    ```image
    light: true
    span: 4
    src: "/log/nov2018/2018-11-21-12-16-53.png"
    ```
8. Tentatively added a close icon in the top right corner of the panel. This is a standard practice to give the user a clear action to take to close the panel. It would also be a more accessible interaction in instances of a user navigating by touch as opposed to mouse.
9. Adjusted the "Rewards Summary" and "Month Year" titles to follow the type scale.
    - Adjusted the color from two to one color that will assume the "accent variable" of the component group for theming. This is an important workflow consideration. Components assume theme variables and typically each component assumes an "accent" color that will get assigned to shared components that live within. For instance, the accent color in this design will assume the Title colors, the tertiary button text/icon at the bottom.
    - Changed the case structure from all caps to Title Case for the Title. I don't know if there is enough consistent design examples in place yet to definitevely define the Brave headline patterns but I'm sure we will work into it. I do think we are safe to assume we won't always default to caps for all titles but there could be a pattern for having any leading subhead be all caps.
