## Top Tips for Writing Effective Design Guidelines

As a team begins authoring, propose the following conventions as a starting point:

- Write imperatives that begin with words like Hide, Include, Prevent, Limit, and Enable.
- Omit needless words. If you can say something with fewer words, do so.
- Assert non-negotiables with Always or Never.
- Encourage a reader’s judgment with Consider or Avoid.
- Succinctly redirect to an appropriate alternative with a subsequent sentence beginning with “Instead, use Tooltip.”
- Favor positives over negatives, such as “Always include a logo in global navigation” over “Never omit a logo from global navigation.”
- Favor lists over paragraphs. Readers want to learn quickly or find an item. So don’t bury advice in dense prose unless absolutely necessary.
- Limit guidelines length to two sentences or less.
- Favor specific advice that’s objective, concise and often quantitative over subjective, qualitative, and laborious explanations.
- Early on, good habits elude writers. Initial editorial passes across Button, Input, and Tooltip can result in a bloody mess of Google Doc suggestions.
